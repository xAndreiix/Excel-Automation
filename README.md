## ✅ Usage

Place your Excel files in the project directory (e.g. transactions.xlsx) and run:

```bash 
python app.py

The script will read the input Excel file, process the data, and update the workbook or create a new one depending on your use case.

Example
Input (transactions.xlsx)
Date	        Description	       Amount
2025-01-05	Office Supplies	       120.50
2025-01-10	Client Payment	       950.00
2025-01-15	Software License       300.00

Output (automated update by script)
Date	        Description	   Amount	Category
2025-01-05	Office Supplies	   120.50	Expense
2025-01-10	Client Payment	   950.00	Income
2025-01-15	Software License   300.00	Expense

The script automatically categorizes transactions and can be extended to add more rules, generate reports, or export summaries.
